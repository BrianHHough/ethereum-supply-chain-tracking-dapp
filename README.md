# Ethereum DApp for Tracking Items Through the Supply Chain

I created a DApp supply chain solution to prove the authenticity of coffee by leveraging the transparency, traceability and efficiency of the Ethereum blockchain network. I built smart contracts that manage specific user permission controls as well as contracts that track and verify a productâ€™s authenticity.

# Part 1: Plan the Project With Write-Ups

## Requirement 1: UML Architecture Diagrams (Project Write-Up)

- **[Activity Diagram](./architecture/UML-Diagrams-Activity-Diagram.png):** Flow of one activity to another in the system. Captures dynamic behavior of the system.

- **[Sequence Diagram](./architecture/UML-Diagrams-Sequence-Diagram.png):** Integration between objects in the sequence in which they take place.

- **[State Diagram](./architecture/UML-Diagrams-State-Diagram.png):** Shows changes from one state to another and usually depicts the creation state and final states if there are any.

- **[Classes Diagram (Data Model)](./architecture/UML-Diagrams-Class-(Data-Modeling).png):** A structure that represents the components of a systems by illustrating the system's classes, attributes, operations, and how the objects may be connected.

- For Practice to warm-up: [LucidChart tutorial on ATM transactions with a bank](./architecture/Practice-Sequence-Diagram-Example-(LucidChart).png) based on this [LucidChart video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCK6prSq8aw)


## Requirement 2: Project Write-up - Libraries

### Programming Libraries Used:
- **Truffle v5.1.14-nodeLTS.0 (core: 5.1.13):** used in project to deploy, test, and deploy DApp's smart contracts.
- **Solidity v0.5.16 (solc-js):** an object-oriented, high-level langauge for writing, designing, and implementing smart contracts.
- **OpenZeppelin v2.1.2:** minimizes risk by using battle-tested libraries of smart contracts. 
- **Node v12.16.2:** used for easily building fast and scalable network applications - integral for deploying UI to the browswer.
- **Web3.js v1.2.1:** used to allow the DApp to interact with a local/remote Ethereum node with an HTTP, HTTPS, or IPC connection.

### Technologies used:
- **Ganache:** used to develop, deploy, and test the DApp in a safe and deterministic environment before deploying.
- **Visual Studio Code:** IDE
- **Infura:** used to run the application without needing to set up an Ethereum node or wallet by using a hosted Ethereum node cluster.
- **Diagrams.net:** used to design the UML diagrams and DAPP/blockchain architecture before building.
