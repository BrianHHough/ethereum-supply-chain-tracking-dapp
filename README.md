# Ethereum DApp for Tracking Items Through the Supply Chain

I created a DApp supply chain solution backed by the Ethereum platform. I architected smart contracts that manage specific user permission controls as well as contracts that track and verify a productâ€™s authenticity.

## Resources

___

## Part 1: Plan the project with write-ups

### Requirement 1: Project write-up - UML architecture diagrams

- [Activity diagram](.../architecture/UML-Diagrams-Activity Diagram.png): - Flow of one activity to another in the system. Captures dynamic behavior of the system.

- Class diagram: A structure that represents the components of a systems by illustrating the system's classes, attributes, operations, and how the objects may be connected.

- Object diagram: A pectoral graph describing instances and their associated objects and data values.

- State diagram: - Shows changes from one state to another and usually depicts the creation state and final states if there are any.


- Sequence diagram: - Integration between objects in the sequence in which they take place.
